# Inventory-Optimization-for-retail_project-oracle-
**Project Overview**
This project focuses on a core business challenge in the retail sector: Inventory Optimization. The goal was to analyze complex sales and stock data to develop data-driven strategies that minimize inventory holding costs while simultaneously maximizing product availability (preventing stockouts).

**Key Features and Analytical Workflow**
This repository demonstrates expertise in handling critical retail data through a robust analytical pipeline:

**Database Management (Oracle)**:

The complete retail dataset (including sales history, stock levels, and product master data) was efficiently stored and managed using Oracle Database.

Complex SQL queries were executed to extract and aggregate the necessary data for analysis.

**In-Depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

Thorough EDA was performed to uncover underlying patterns that drive demand. Key analyses included:

**Demand Forecasting**: Analyzing historical sales trends, seasonality, and promotional impacts.

**Stock Health Check**: Identifying slow-moving and fast-moving items.

**Variance Analysis**: Understanding the volatility of demand and lead times.

**Visualization and Strategic Recommendations (Power BI)**:

A comprehensive and interactive dashboard was developed in Power BI to present the findings.

The visualizations clearly show key inventory KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and provide actionable recommendations for optimal reorder points and safety stock levels.

Business Impact
This solution enables stakeholders to:

Accurately forecast future demand.

Reduce capital tied up in excess stock.

Improve customer satisfaction by minimizing out-of-stock incidents.

Technologies Used
Database: Oracle

Analysis & Logic: Python (Pandas, NumPy for EDA)

Visualization: Power BI
